  </div>Toyko is by far the cleanest city to which I have ever travelled. 
  It is aso the largest and busiest city to which I have ever travelled. 
  The amount of effort the people of Tokyo go to in order
   to ensure both sanity and sanitation is simply astounding.
  Sights one must visit while in Tokyo include 
  Harajuku (shopping/fashion), Ueno 
  (Ameyoko for cheap shopping / Ueno Park/zoo), 
  Shibuya (area for young adults), 
  and Shinjuku (nightlife / red light district).

    </div>I enjoy exploring Tokyo for it's innovative technology,
     it's delicious high quality cuisine and the shopping.
      I loved visiting the electronics district (Akihabara), 
      especially Yodobashi electronics store to see what are the latest gadgets,
       visiting the trendy district (Shibuya) for it's stylish clothes and anime.
        Toys are everywhere. Japanese anime is everywhere.
         My favorite stores to visit for that are Kiddy Land & Snoopy Town in Harajuku.
          So much to see, so little time to see everything. 
          Try to stay at least one week in Tokyo before visiting other cities in Japan. 
          You'll need at least that amount of time to see a good portion of Tokyo.

      </div>We just got back from spending 9 amazing days in Tokyo, and already want to go back.
       There is so much to see and do there. 
       For those who have never been to a foreign country, 
       don't let that stop you. Tokyo is very safe. 
       And the language barrier is difficult at times,
        but there are enough Japanese that speak at least some English that this is not a problem.
         I traveled with my sister plus my older teenage daughter and son. W
         e felt perfectly safe everywhere we went, day or night.
      You travel everywhere on trains which are fast and efficient. 
      My best recommendation is to buy a Suica card that you can easily add money to in any subway station.

        </div>First off i would suggest researching the top places to go before your trip.
        its a very large city with so much to see and do it can be overwhelming. 
        one suggestion is Ueno Park, its a nice place to go for a walk, 
        see some temples, and visit the Tokyo National Museum.

        Trains- if you are not familiar with the language 
        i would suggest checking out hyperdia, 
        its a good way to search, in english, for train departure times, ect,
         and will give you the platform in which they leave.
