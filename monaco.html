  </div>We fly to Nice airport and got the bus to monaco, 
    I was very dubious about the city and if it would hold my attention for 4 days.
    So I picked up plenty of leaflets in the tourist information office just in case....
    I need not have bothered ! My only question now is when can I return...
    It was the most relaxing short break I have had, that says a lot as I dont tend to relax. 
    I like to see and go all the time. Everything about the place is excellent,
    when you get past the hype of billionares and fancy cars, 
    the great and bueatiful struttung their well heeled stuff at the casino.

    Don't let the fact that Monaco is one of the most expensive
    destinations in Europe detour you from going .
    You can easily spend the whole day there without the huge expense, 
    this is how: Purchase a Le Club card through (--)for $55. 
    This card is a gem and well worth the splurge! 
    It allows you into every museum in Monaco for free, shopping discounts at countless stores 
    (which includes a glass of complimentary champagne while you shop),
    discounts at restaurants and spas. 
    My personal favorite discount is one complimentary helicoptor ride.

      </div>Monaco is surprisingly small. 
      We got there easily by a 1 hour train journey from Cannes. 
      The station is a vast, clean subterranean complex with two or three ways out.
      Take the route towards the 'Jardin' and you should find yourself near to the Royal Palace,
      situated on a high point this provides the best vantage point to orientate yourself. 
      The square outside the Palace is beautiful and you can explore the old town from here. 
      A visit to the 11 rooms in the Palace is worth it for 9 euros and 
      you get to into the Napoleonic relics museum on the same ticket. 
      Go then to the Cathedral and then it is a short walk to the Bus Stop for the tour train.

        </div>We were in Monaco in early summer - we were based in Nice (Nice) and went on an excursion.
         Important - do not go to Monaco in the rain, the city is only fun when the sun is shining.

        Monaco is actually not expensive, unless you go to the Cafe de Paris or other expensive establishments
        -but most of the sights (castle, houses, churches, parks) can be visited free of charge. 
        In addition, there is the great location on the rock and the extreme cleanliness of the city.
